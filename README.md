# Light Navigator Bot

Move a bot to the bright spot on the wall in a dark room

### Downsampling ideas
Max pooling

store n lines, average over n lines, so 2^n size reduction

bot can only turn horizontally. vertical resolution not needed. can orient camera such that one line is vertical, then can greatly downsample line, maybe even take average.
